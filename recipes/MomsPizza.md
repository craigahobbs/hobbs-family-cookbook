Title: Mom's Pizza
~~~

### Crust

Stir together in a large measuring cup and let stand for 10 minutes:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 3/4 C warm water (110 degrees)

2 Tbsp dry yeast (two packages)

2 tsp sugar
~~~

Using a Cuisinart bowl with the blade attachment, mix together:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
4 1/2 C flour

2 tsp salt

2 Tbsp olive oil
~~~

With the motor running, slowly add the liquid mixture to the dry ingredients until a soft dough is
formed. With the motor off, extract the dough ball and turn into a greased bowl.

Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise until double. "Punch" the dough down and divide into two
balls. Roll each ball out on a floured surface and place on an oiled 15" pizza pan. Cover the crust
with toppings as follows.


### Pizza Sauce

Using a Cuisinart with the blade attachment, add and process until just slightly chunky:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes packed in their own juice

1 6 oz can tomato paste

3 to 4 cloves peeled garlic lightly chopped

2 Tbsp lightly chopped fresh flat leafed parsley

1 tsp dried oregano leaves

1 to 2 Tbsp fresh basil lightly chopped

2 Tbsp olive oil

1 pinch of red pepper flakes
~~~

Salt and pepper to taste.

Spread the finished sauce liberally on the pizza crust.


### Combination Pizza Toppings

Saute until almost cooked through and drain:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1/2 lb fresh, lean ground beef

1/2 large yellow onion diced

1/2 green pepper diced

8 large mushrooms sliced

3/4 lb grated mozzarella cheese

2 oz sliced pepperoni

1/2 C grated fresh parmesan cheese
~~~

Salt and pepper to taste (remembering that there is a lot of salt in the cheese that will top the
pizza)

Top the sauced crust with grated mozzarella cheese. Cover the cheese with pepperoni slices and
distribute the meat and vegetable mixture over that. Sprinkle with grated fresh parmesan cheese and
bake in a 425 degree oven for about 20 to 25 minutes until cheese is bubbly and crust is browned.


### Pepperoni Pizza Toppings

~~~ recipe-ingredients
3/4 lb grated mozzarella cheese

2 oz sliced pepperoni

1/2 C grated fresh parmesan cheese
~~~

Top the sauced crust with grated mozzarella cheese. Distribute pepperoni slices evenly over the
cheese, sprinkle with freshly grated parmesan cheese and bake at 425 degree for about 18 to 20
minutes until cheese is bubbly and crust is browned. I nearly always "mop" the top with paper towels
to remove some of the grease.


### Canadian Bacon and Fresh Tomatoes

~~~ recipe-ingredients
3/4 lb grated mozzarella cheese

2 oz sliced Canadian bacon

1/2 C grated fresh parmesan cheese

2 tomatoes, thinly sliced
~~~

Top the sauced crust with grated mozzarella cheese. Distribute sliced Canadian bacon evenly over the
cheese and sprinkle with freshly grated parmesan cheese. Bake in a 425 degree oven for 18 to 20
minutes until cheese is bubbly and crust is browned. Top the baked pie with thinly slice fresh
tomatoes and serve.

The dough balls and the sauce can be made ahead of time and frozen individually. Allow them to thaw
and then proceed to make the pie.
