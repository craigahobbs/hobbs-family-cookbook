Cream together:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1/2 C butter

1 C sugar
~~~

Add and beat in:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
2 eggs

4 Tbsp sour milk*

3 mashed ripe bananas
~~~

Add and stir in:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
2 C flour

1 tsp baking soda

1/2 C chopped pecans
~~~

Turn the batter into a buttered glass loaf pan and bake in a 350 degree for 1 hour or until a
toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool the bread in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes,
then loosen the edges with a knife blade and turn out onto a cutting board and continue to cool or
slice and serve.

\* Mix the milk and the white vinegar (I'm convinced that this step is what makes this banana bread
so great. Use vinegar, not lemon juice.)

~~~ recipe-ingredients
4 Tbsp milk

2 tsp white vinegar

I sometimes double the recipe and freeze the second loaf.
