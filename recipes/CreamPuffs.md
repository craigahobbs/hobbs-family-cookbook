    '1/2 C butter' \
))
~~~

Add and stir in over low heat until a ball forms:

    '1 C flour' \
))
~~~

Remove from heat and beat in the eggs, one at a time until smooth.

    '4 eggs' \
))

Drop the batter by spoon onto an ungreased baking sheet, 3" apart. Bake 45 to 50 minutes in a 400
degree oven. Allow the puffs to cool slowly away from drafts. To store, cover with clean towel on a
plate on the counter.

To serve, cut the tops off the puffs, clean out any moist membranes inside, and fill with the
following, dust with powdered sugar.


### Cream Filling

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '1 large pkg (4.6 oz) Jello cook & serve vanilla pudding (see preparation below)', \
    '1 C whipping cream beaten firmly', \
    '1/2 tsp rum extract', \
    '2 1/2 C milk' \
))
~~~

Prepare the pudding according to package directions, except use the above milk quantity (I always
use diluted evaporated milk). Turn the cooked pudding into a large bowl and chill until firm. Fold
in the beaten whipped cream and rum flavoring and spoon into the puffs.

This has always been a favorite family dessert. When Aunt Marilin and Uncle Jim and I were kids, we
wouldn't have gotten dessert very often if it hadn't been for Aunt Laura. She came to Sunday dinner
every week, and always brought dessert. Everything she made was great.
