Prepare the sauce by mixing together:

recipeIngredients( \
    '1/2 C Mayonnaise', \
    '3 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice', \
    '1 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley', \
    '1 large thinly sliced green onion', \
    '1 Tbsp chopped fresh thyme', \
    '1/2 tsp salt' \
)
~~~

Freshly ground pepper to taste.

Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

recipeIngredients( \
    '4 8 oz skinless halibut fillets' \
)
~~~

Clean and pat dry the halibut fillets, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and dust with flour. Heat 1 to
2 Tbsp olive oil in a large saute pan and sear the prepared fillets until golden brown on both
sides, lower the heat and continue to cook until the fish flakes when tested with a fork and the
center of the fillet is opaque. Serve the fish with the sauce.

This is one of the best fish recipes I have ever had. It is so simple and quick, yet everyone asks
for the recipe. I like to serve this with fresh asparagus and roasted red potatoes.
