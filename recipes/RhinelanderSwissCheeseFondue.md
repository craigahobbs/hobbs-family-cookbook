This recipe comes from the Rhinelander Restaurant in Portland, Oregon. When Dad and I were first
married we could eat a complete meal (fondue, lentil soup, salad, complete dinner, and dessert)
there for $3.25 apiece. Needless to say, it was one of our favorite restaurants! The Rhinelander is
still in its' original location on Burnside in Portland, but it is a lot more expensive now.
