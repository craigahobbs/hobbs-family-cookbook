~~~ markdown-script

With a Cuisinart, process vanilla wafers to form crumbs.

Combine:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients( \
    '2 C vanilla wafer crumbs', \
    '2 C finely chopped pecans', \
    '2 C confectioners sugar', \
    '4 tbsp cocoa', \
    '1/2 C bourbon', \
    '3 Tbsp light corn syrup' \
)
~~~

Mix to form a stiff dough. Form the dough into 1" balls and roll in powdered sugar. Refrigerate and
store in airtight container (at Xmas I store these in the garage) until ready to use. These balls do
need to age for a week or two or longer.
