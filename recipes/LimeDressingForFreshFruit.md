Whisk together in a small saucepan and stir over medium heat until thickened:

recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '1 egg', \
    '1/4 cup fresh lime juice', \
    '1/2 cup honey' \
))

Blend in:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '1 cup sour cream', \
    '1 pinch of salt', \
    '1 pinch of ground mace', \
    '1 tsp poppy seeds' \
))
~~~

Place mixture in serving bowl and refrigerate until ready to use. I usually pass this dressing to be
served with a medley of fruits such as sliced strawberries, blackberries, and melon balls (honeydew
& cantaloupe).

This is an old southern recipe and is absolutely delicious. The dressing will keep for up to a week
refrigerated.
