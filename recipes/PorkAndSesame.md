recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '2 pork tenderloins, trimmed', \
    '1 C ketchup', \
    '1/3 C sugar', \
    '3 Tbsp soy sauce', \
    '3 to 4 cloves minced garlic', \
    '1/2 tsp dried ginger powder' \
))

Marinate the pork tenderloins in the above for 20 to 30 minutes. Prepare a cookie sheet or roasting
pan by lining it with foil and place a baking rack sprayed with non stick cooking spray on it. Place
the pork tenderloins on the rack 3" apart and bake at 325 degrees for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes
baste the top of the loins with the marinade and continue to bake for another 20 to 30 minutes until
the top of the loins is beginning to brown and "crust". Turn the loins over, baste and continue to
bake until the second side is like the first. When pork is done the temperature should read 165 to
170 degrees. Remove the loins to a serving plate and let cool completely. Slice on the diagonal and
serve with red sauce (see recipe for egg rolls) and Chinese mustard and toasted sesame seeds.

Serve cool with rice and stir fried vegetables.

Leftover pork is delicious in a sandwich with mayo, plum sauce, and lettuce or diced and added to
fried rice see
