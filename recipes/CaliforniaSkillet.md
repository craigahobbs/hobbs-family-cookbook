How could I leave this one out!

Brown in a large skillet in olive oil: (skillet should have a lid)

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '1 Tbsp olive oil', \
    '1 lb lean ground beef', \
    '1 large chopped onion diced' \
))
~~~

Stir in, cover and cook  on low heat for 25 minutes:

recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '2 1/2 C water', \
    '1 C white rice', \
    '3 beef bouillon cubes, crushed', \
    '1/2 tsp dry mustard' \
))
~~~

Stir in:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '1 medium diced green pepper', \
    '1 medium diced tomato' \
))
~~~

Sprinkle with:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '1 C shredded Monterey Jack cheese' \
))
~~~

Remove the skillet from heat, cover and let stand for 3 - 5 minutes.

This is an easy one dish meal which I always served with buttered corn and Brownie pudding for
dessert.
