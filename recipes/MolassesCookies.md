Beat well until combined. Drop by large spoonfuls (1 1/2 tbsp) each amount dipped in turbinado sugar
crystals & bake on a parchment lined cookie sheet. Space cookies 2" apart as they will spread. Bake
in 325 degree oven for 16 minutes (cookies will be slightly underdone), remove pan from the oven and
allow cookies to sit for 1 minute before moving to a parchment paper on the counter.

These cookies freeze well.
