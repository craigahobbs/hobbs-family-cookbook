recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '3 lbs lean beef chuck, cut into 1" chunks', \
    '2 Tbsp olive oil', \
    '1 1/2 C water', \
    '1 package taco seasoning mix', \
    '1 Tbsp butter, softened', \
    '1 Tbsp flour' \
))
~~~

Using a 4.5 qt dutch oven, sear beef chunks (which have been salted and peppered) in the olive oil.
When the meat is browned, add the water, cover and cook on low heat until the meat is very tender (1
1/2 to 2 hours). When the meat is tender add the package of taco seasoning mix and butter mixed with
the flour. Cook 15 to 20 minutes until thickened and savory. At any point during the cooking process
add additional liquid if mixture seems dry.

Use a large skillet with 1/4" vegetable oil heated until hot over a medium burner. Saute corn
tortillas one at a time, just until slightly crisp, remove and drain on paper towels and lightly
fold over. Continue until all the desired tortillas are cooked.

Prepare the toppings as follows:

    '2 C shredded  iceberg or romaine lettuce', \
    '2 C shredded medium cheddar cheese', \
    '2 diced fresh tomatoes' \
))

Other topping ideas:

- sliced ripe olives
- prepared salsa
- light sour cream
- diced avocado or guacamole

Let each person prepare their own taco to order.

Leftover taco meat can be made into enchiladas or burritos.
