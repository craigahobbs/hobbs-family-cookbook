recipeIngredients( \
    '3 C Bisquick', \
    '1 lb shredded cheddar cheese', \
    '1 lb Jimmy Deans hot sausage warmed to room temperature' \
)
~~~

Shape the dough into balls about the size of ping pong balls. Bake on a greased cookie sheet at 350
degrees for 25 minutes and serve warm.

This is an old recipe from the days when we lived in Olympia and a favorite Sunday night dinner at
our house with deviled eggs, carrot sticks, and dill spears. I have tried to make this with light
sausage, but the "biscuits" turn out like hockey pucks.
