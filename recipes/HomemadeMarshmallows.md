    '2 C sugar', \
    '3/4 C light Karo corn syrup', \
    '1/2 C water', \
    '1/4 tsp salt' \
))
~~~

Cook, stirring, over medium heat until mixture comes to a boil. Continue to cook and stir over
medium low heat until mixture reaches the "firm ball" stage (242 to 248 degrees or mixture forms a
firm ball when dropped into cold water). Do not overcook.

With the electric mixer on low, slowly pour the mixture into the gelatin. Continue to beat on higher
speed for 15 minutes and mixture is light and fluffy. Mix in the vanilla extract.
