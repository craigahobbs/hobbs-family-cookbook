Prepare batter by whisking together:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients( \
    '1/2 C flour', \
    '1/2 C cornstarch', \
    '1/2 tsp salt', \
    '1 1/2 tsp baking powder', \
    '2 egg whites', \
    '1 C water' \
)
~~~

Batter will be thin.

Slice two to three large sweet onions (white onions are also good) 1/4" to 1/3" thick. Dip in the
batter* and deep fry in canola oil (approximately 5 C) at 375 degrees. Remove rings when golden
brown and crispy and drain on paper towels.

Serve warm with Colonial Dressing or Tartar Sauce.
