Salt and pepper to taste.

Set oven to 475 degrees. Rub the red peppers lightly with vegetable oil and place on a foil lined
pan several inches apart. Bake until pepper skin is mostly black about 20-25 minutes and remove
peppers with tongs to a plastic bag. When peppers are cool enough to handle, pull off blackened
skins, seeds, veins and stems and discard. Roughly chop the pepper "flesh" into one-half inch
pieces.

In a 3- to 4-quart pan over medium-high heat, stir onions in butter until limp, about 3 minutes.
Stir in peppers and carrots and cook until slightly soft.

Add flour and stir about 1 minute. Add broth, half-and-half and tomato sauce. Stir until mixture
boils and is slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.

Stir in chili flakes, salt and pepper to taste and simmer for 10-20 minutes. Using a handheld
blender process until soup is smooth (some texture will still show). Like all soups, this is better
if made a day ahead but can be eaten right away.
