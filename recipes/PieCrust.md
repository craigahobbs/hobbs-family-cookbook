Dice and chill:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
2 sticks of butter
~~~

Add to Cuisinart bowl and process. Then add the chilled butter and pulse until butter forms pea size lumps:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
2 1/4 C flour

1 tsp salt

2 sticks cold butter
~~~

Gradually add the ice water and process until dough just forms clumps on the top of the blades (the
amount of water depends on how "dry" the flour is, this varies with the seasons).

~~~ recipe-ingredients
8 Tbsp ice water or more
~~~

Remove the dough from the bowl, divide into two pieces. Place each piece into a zip sandwich bag and
press each into round flat disc and refrigerate for at least 1/2 hour.

Remove the dough from the frig and roll out on a floured surface. Fold over and place in a 9" pie
pan (I prefer glass) and trim to 1" beyond edge of the pan. At this point, flute the edge and prick
the crust with a fork for a single crust; or fill without piercing for a two crust pie.  Moisten
the edge before adding the second crust, flute and vent, then bake for a double crust pie.

Single crusts (or pie crust cookies) are baked, unfilled, in a 475 degree oven for 8 to 10 minutes.
Double filled crusts are generally baked in a 425 degree oven for 35 to 45 minutes or as recipe
directs, until filling is bubbly and crust is golden brown.

Double crust pies may be brushed with and egg wash, the egg yolk whisked with the water and brushed
on the crust before baking.

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 egg yolk

1 1/2 tbsp of water
