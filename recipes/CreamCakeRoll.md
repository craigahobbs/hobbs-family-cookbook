# Cream Cake Roll

~~~ markdown-script

~~~

Line a jelly roll pan, 15 1/2" X 10 1/2" X 1", with greased foil. (grease the pan first, the foil
stays in place better)

Use an electric mixer to beat the eggs until thick and lemon colored. Gradually beat in the sugar.
Now blend in the water and the vanilla.

recipeIngredients([ \
    '3 large eggs', \
    '1 C sugar', \
    '1/3 C water', \
    '1 tsp vanilla' \
])
~~~

Mix in to form a smooth batter:

recipeIngredients([ \
    '1 C flour', \
    '1/4 tsp salt', \
    '1 tsp baking powder' \
])
~~~

Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pan and bake at 375 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes, until
golden brown. Remove cake from oven, immediately turn pan upside down on a clean, smooth kitchen
towel which has been sprinkled liberally with **powdered sugar**. Remove the foil from the cake
carefully and sprinkle the cake with more powdered sugar. Fold the edge of the towel over the short
end of the cake, and roll up while still hot. Place the roll on a cake rack and allow to cool
completely.

When the cake is cool, carefully unroll and fill with cream filling leaving the last inch
"unfrosted". Turn seam side down on an oval serving platter.
