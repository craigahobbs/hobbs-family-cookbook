Assemble the pie using a 9" glass pie pan. Roll one disc of the pastry out on a lightly floured
board and fit (do not stretch) into the pie pan and trim the dough 1/2" over the edge of the pan.

Sprinkle the bottom of the pie crust with the grated parmesan cheese. Drain the potatoes on a paper
towel and slice into 1/8" rounds.

Use the
[pie crust](#url=PieCrust.md&var.vCategory='Desserts')
recipe in the dessert portion of the book and form the bottom crust of the torte. Layer 1/3 of the
sliced potato over the bottom of the crust, sprinkle with a pinch of kosher salt and several grinds
of black pepper. Next, strew 1/3 of the crisped bacon over the potatoes and sprinkle with 1/3 of the
Gruyere cheese. Repeat two more layers. Remove the thyme from the cream and pour the cream over the
potato layers.

Roll out the second disc of pastry to an 11 1/2" round. Moisten the trimmed edges of the bottom
crust with a little cold water, fold the second crust in half and lay it over the pie. Trim any
excess of the upper crust, press the top crust edge to the lower crust and flute. Cut 5 1" slits
(vents) in the top of the pie and brush with egg wash (1 egg yolk whisked with 1 1/2 Tbsp of water).
Bake the pie at 375 degrees for 60 to 65 minutes. The pie is done when the crust is golden brown and
the potato slices offer no resistance when skewered with a toothpick through one of the vents.
