Author: Shannon Childs
~~~

Gently toss together in a buttered 9 X 13" baking dish:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
8 C frozen* or fresh berries (blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, or marian berries or a mixture)

1/4 C flour

3/4 sugar (depending on the sweetness of the berries)
~~~

Crust topping; mix together in a medium bowl:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 C flour

1 C sugar

1 tsp baking powder

1 beaten egg
~~~

Mixture will look crumbly. Spread evenly over the berries. Melt one cube of butter and pour evenly
over the whole mixture. Bake at 375 degrees for 45 minutes or until bubbly.

Serve with whipped cream or ice cream.

\* If using frozen berries, let thaw slightly.

When the kids were little we would pick blackberries here on the Island and freeze them for winter
use. We had lots of "free" desserts.
