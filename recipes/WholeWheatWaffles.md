recipeIngredients([ \
    '2 C of buttermilk (at room temperature)', \
    '3 eggs', \
    '2 Tbsp melted butter' \
])

Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry until combined, then allow to rest for 5 minutes.

Ladle batter into hot, oiled waffle iron, and cook til done (on my waffle iron that is usually about
4 1/2 to 5 minutes). Serve hot.
