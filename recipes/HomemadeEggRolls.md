    '1/2 lb lean ground pork', \
    '2 Tbsp vegetable oil' \
)
~~~

Add and continue to saute until vegetables are just limp:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients( \
    '1 grated carrot', \
    '1 small julienned yellow onion', \
    '4 sliced green onions', \
    '1/2  head shredded napa cabbage', \
    '1 Tbsp soy sauce', \
    '1/2 tsp ground ginger', \
    '1 tsp sesame oil' \
)
~~~

Stir in soy sauce, ground ginger, and sesame oil. Place about 2 Tbsp meat and vegetable mixture
diagonally across an eggroll wrapper, fold one side over, moisten other three corners, fold ends up
and seal, then roll (not too tightly) to make a "log" shape. Turn rolls seam side down on a cookie
sheet lined with paper towels. Continue until all the wrappers and filling is used up. Leftover
wrappers may be refrozen. Refrigerate rolls until ready to deep fry.

Heat 1 qt of oil to 375 degrees in a dutch oven or deep fat fryer. Fry the egg rolls a few at a time
until golden brown and crispy on all sides. Drain on paper towels and keep finished rolls warm in
200 degree oven until all rolls have been fried. Serve warm with red sauce or tempura dipping sauce.

with just enough water to make it the consistency of prepared mustard), and toasted sesame seeds.
