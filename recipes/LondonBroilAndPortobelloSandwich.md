Prepare the spread by mixing together:

3/4 C mayonnaise

2 Tbsp prepared horseradish

1/2 C chopped fresh parsley

1/2 freshly squeezed lemon juice (1 - 2 Tbsp)

Salt and pepper to taste.

Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

4 portobello mushrooms

1 large sweet onion

1/4 C balsamic vinegar

1/4 C olive oil

Clean and slice the portobello mushrooms (scoop out the dark gills) and the sweet onion. Line a
large baking sheet with foil and spread out the sliced vegetables in a single layer, toss with the
balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and salt and pepper. Bake in a 400 degree oven for 10 minutes or until
vegetables are tender. Place in a serving bowl and set aside to cool slightly.

Brush the prepared flank steak with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill to the
desired doneness. Let the steak rest for 5 minutes and slice thinly against the grain.

2 loaf ciabatta bread sliced in 1/2 and cut into 6 servings

Let everyone assemble their own sandwich using all of the above ingredients. I serve this with
freshly sliced fruit. It is a delicious summer meal.
