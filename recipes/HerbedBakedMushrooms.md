~~~ markdown-script

~~~

Mix together in a 1 qt buttered baking dish:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '1 lb cleaned, trimmed, halved fresh mushroom caps', \
    '2 Tbsp melted butter', \
    '1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice', \
    '1 tsp dried dill weed', \
    '1/2 tsp onion powder', \
    '1/2 tsp salt' \
))
~~~

Freshly ground pepper to taste.

Cover with foil and bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes or until mushrooms are tender and golden
brown.

This is a great easy appetizer (served warm with toothpicks), or served with beef roast as a side
dish.
