Spoon a small (tsp) amount of filling into baked crusts and return to the oven and bake until
filling bubbles and the shells are golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool for 10 minutes, then
using a sharp knife, slip the blade around the tart and remove from the pan. Continue to cool, then
store in an airtight container in a cool place or freeze until 1/2 hour before serving.
