Place the bread on a cutting board and use a cookie or biscuit cutter to cut a hole in the center of
the bread. Lightly butter both sides of the "raft" and "sail" which you cut out.

Heat a non stick skillet or griddle on a medium burner. Place the buttered bread on the cooking
surface. Place a dot of butter in the hole of the "raft", and crack an egg into the melted butter.
Salt and pepper the egg and allow it to set up. Turn the bread and egg over as well as the "sail" so
that both sides are golden brown.

To serve, put the "raft" on a serving plate. Use a large toothpick to skewer the "sail" and stick
the "mast" in the crust of the 'raft".

Nonny made this for Dad when he was young and I made it for our kids (Teresa and Craig A.)
