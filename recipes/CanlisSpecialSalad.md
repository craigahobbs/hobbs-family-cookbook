Combine in a blender:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
4 tbsp fresh lemon juice

5 oz olive oil

1/4 tsp fresh mint

1/4 tsp dried oregano

1 coddled egg

1 clove garlic

1 tsp salt

1/2 tsp pepper
~~~

Combine in a large salad bowl:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
2 heads chopped cleaned romaine lettuce

2 large chopped tomatoes

1/4 C sliced green onions

1 lb crisp cooked diced bacon

1/2 C freshly grated Romano cheese (I sometimes add 1/4 C of parmesan, too)

1 C croutons
~~~

Toss with the dressing and serve.

If making ahead, I separately bag everything, then combine them when ready to toss.
