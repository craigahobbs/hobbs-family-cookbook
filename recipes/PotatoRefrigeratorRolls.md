Turn dough onto a floured board and knead until smooth and elastic. Place dough in a greased bowl
cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours. Two hours before
baking, remove as much dough as you wish to use, shape\*, and place on a greased baking sheet. Let
rolls rise until double (about 1 1/2 to 2 hours) and bake at 400 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes.

\* I usually form these rolls as a "toad-in-hole" which is a knot with the longest end pulled up
through the center of the knot. You can also shape as cloverleaf (3 small balls in each cup of a
muffin tin). Brush rolls with 1 egg white beaten with 1 Tbsp water and then sprinkle with sesame
seeds. Leave plenty of room on the baking sheet for the rolls to expand.

These are delicious yeasty rolls which can be made fresh all week long. The dough will keep in the
refrigerator for 5 to 6 days. Leftover rolls have always been a favorite for breakfast the next
morning at our house.
