Turn batter into a tube (angel food cake pan) or bundt pan which has been greased and dusted with
flour. Bake at 350 degrees for 65 minutes. Coo! the cake in the pan for at least one hour and turn
upside down on a cake plate. Dust with powdered sugar and serve with whipped cream.

The flavor of this cake is better the second day. This cake is great for breakfast, too.
