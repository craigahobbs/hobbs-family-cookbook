Title: Eggs Benedict
~~~

Split and toast the english muffins, butter and place on a baking sheet, top with the Canadian bacon
and place in a warm (200 degree) oven.

~~~ recipe-ingredients
2 English muffins
4 slices Canadian bacon, lightly sauteed
~~~

Prepare the **hollandaise sauce** as follows:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
2 egg yolks

2 Tbsp champagne

1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice

1 cube butter cut in half
~~~

Place the first 3 ingredients in a sauce pan and whisk together. Put half of the butter in the pan
and continue to whisk over medium heat until the butter is almost melted. Add the other half of the
butter and repeat. The sauce should be thickened and smooth by now, if not continue to stir over
slightly lower heat until it is. Set the sauce aside, stirring occasionally until the eggs are
poached.

Spray a large non stick saute pan with cooking spray. Fill the pan 1 1/2 inch deep with water and
add the white vinegar or lemon juice.

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 Tbsp white vinegar
~~~

1/2 lemon, juiced

Set the pan on a burner and bring the water to a simmering boil. Carefully crack the eggs into the
water, as the eggs cook spoon water over the yolks to set them.

~~~ recipe-ingredients
4 large eggs
~~~

Cook the eggs until the white is set but the center is still soft. Carefully remove each egg with a
slotted spoon to drain and place on the prepared English muffins. Spoon the hollandaise over the top
and serve hot.
