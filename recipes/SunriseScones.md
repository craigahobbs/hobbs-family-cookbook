Combine:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '2 1/4 C flour', \
    '1/4 C sugar', \
    '1 Tbsp baking powder', \
    '1/2 tsp salt' \
))
~~~

Cut in with a pastry blender, (or use a Cuisinart) until mixture looks like course meal:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '1/2 C cold cubed butter' \
))
~~~

Put mixture in a large bowl and add:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '3/4 C half and half or heavy cream mixed with', \
    '1 beaten egg' \
))
~~~

Stir by hand just to blend. Turn dough out on a floured board and knead lightly. Form dough into 3
even balls, press each ball into a 5 1/2 " circle. Next cut each circle into quarters, and place
each on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees for 14-18 minutes. Serve hot with jam and
butter.
