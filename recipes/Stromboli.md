Title: Stromboli
~~~

~~~ recipe-ingredients
2 1 lb loaves frozen bread dough

2 Tbsp Dijon mustard

8 oz thinly sliced salami

8 oz thinly sliced provolone cheese

8 oz thinly sliced ham

8 oz thinly sliced mozzarella cheese

8 oz Italian sausage, crumbled, cooked, and drained
~~~


### Topping

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1/4 C melted butter

1/4 C parmesan cheese

1 tsp dried oregano, crushed

1/2 tsp garlic powder
~~~

Thaw the frozen bread dough. On a lightly floured board, roll each into a 16" X 10" rectangle.
Spread the center 1/3 of each rectangle with 1 Tbsp Dijon mustard.

Layer each loaf with 1/2 of each ingredient in the order listed, ending by sprinkling the cooked
sausage on. Fold both sides to the center, moisten with water, and pinch together to seal. Seal the
ends of the loaf and fold in toward center. Then turn both strombolis seam side down on a oiled
baking sheet, brush the tops with melted butter and sprinkle the last 3 ingredients mixed together.

Bake the stromboli at 350 degrees for 25 minutes until the crust is golden brown. Slice and serve
with a salad for a complete meal.

This recipe comes from the Better Homes and Gardens Community Recipe book given to me by Craig A.
for Christmas one year. It quickly became a family favorite.
