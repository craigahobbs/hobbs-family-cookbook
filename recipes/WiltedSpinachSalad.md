Place in a large salad bowl and toss together:

recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '1 lb washed and stemmed baby spinach', \
    '1/2 cup sliced green onions', \
    '8 washed sliced fresh white mushrooms', \
    '1 egg hard boiled cooled and chopped (set aside)', \
    '6 slices thick cut bacon sliced in 1/3" pieces' \
))
~~~

Saute bacon until crisped and drain on a paper towel. Reserve 3 Tbsp bacon drippings in the pan. Add
and cook until bubbly:

    '2 Tbsp red wine vinegar', \
    '1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice', \
    '1 tsp sugar', \
    '1/2 tsp salt' \
))
~~~

Pour the hot dressing over the spinach mixture, top with the crisped bacon and boiled eggs and
freshly ground pepper to taste. Toss and serve immediately.

This makes a great summer meal served with hot buttered french bread and sliced fresh fruit. I
sometimes add grated Jack cheese and toasted sunflower seeds as well.
