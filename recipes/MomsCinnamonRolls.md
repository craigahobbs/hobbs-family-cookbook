Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead until completely smooth and elastic. Round the dough
into a large greased bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place until dough has doubled. Punch the
dough down and let rise a second time until doubled again.

Smooth mixture with hands and roll the dough beginning with the long side into a log. Pinch the
dough to seal. Cut the dough into rounds about 1 1/2" thick and place loosely in prepared pan,
leaving room for the rolls to rise. At this point the pan may be covered and frozen until about 9
hours before baking, or allowed to rise until doubled and baked in a 375 degree oven for 25 to 30
minutes until rolls sound hollow when middle roll is thumped. Remove the pan from the oven, slide
the blade of a knife around the outer edge, place serving platter on top of the pan and holding the
two together firmly flip over so the baking pan is on top.\*. Let rolls sit upside down for a
minute or two and then carefully lift pan off, scraping any leftover topping onto the hot rolls.
Best served hot.

\* I have a large flat tray that I line with foil.
