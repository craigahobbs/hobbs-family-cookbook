# German Chocolate Cake Filling

~~~ markdown-script

A Hobbs family favorite!

Combine in a medium sized saucepan:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '1 cup sugar', \
    '1 cup evaporated milk', \
    '3 egg yolks', \
    '1 stick (1/2 cup) butter', \
    '1 tsp vanilla' \
))
~~~

Cook and stir over medium heat until sauce is thickened, about 12 minutes. Remove from the heat and
add and stir in:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '1 1/3 cup angel flake coconut', \
    '1 cup chopped pecans' \
))
~~~

Cool and spread. This is enough filling for 3- 9" cake layers. I spread each layer with frosting and
then with the filling, this prevents the filling from making the cake soggy. If I am making this
cake for a huge party I bake the cake layers (triple the cake recipe) in my deep dish pizza pan and
then double the filling recipe. Use the chocolate cake and frosting recipes found in this section if
you wish, or use a mix for the cake.
