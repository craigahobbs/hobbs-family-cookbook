Pour the batter into 2 prepared cake pans (greased and floured and lined with greased parchment) and
bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.\*
Allow to cool for ten minutes in the pans, then remove the layers from the pans and cool completely
on a cake rack. Frost with:


### Perfectly Chocolate Frosting

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients( \
    '1/2 C butter', \
    '2/3 cup of cocoa powder', \
    '3 cups of powdered sugar', \
    '1/3 cup milk', \
    '2 tsp vanilla' \
)
~~~

Melt the butter and stir in the cocoa powder. Alternately add the powdered sugar and the milk beating
on a medium speed. Stir in the vanilla. I sometimes make 1 1/2 recipe so that I have plenty of
frosting to generously frost cake.

\* Batter will make approximately 30 cupcakes (2/3 full) bake at 350 degrees for 22 to 25 minutes.
