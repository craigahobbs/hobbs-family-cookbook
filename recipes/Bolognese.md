Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.

Heat the olive oil in a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meat and cook,
crumbling the meat with a wooden spoon, for 5 to 7 minutes, until the meat has lost its pink color
and has started to brown. Stir in the garlic, oregano and red pepper flakes, and cook for 1 more
minute. Pour 1 C of the wine into the skillet and stir to scrape up any browned bits. Add the
tomatoes, tomato paste, Kosher salt and black pepper to taste, stirring until combined. Bring to a
boil, lower heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil, add 1 tsp of salt, a splash of olive oil and the
pasta, and cook according to the directions on the box.

While the pasta cooks, finish the sauce. Add the nutmeg, basil, cream and the remaining dry red wine
to the sauce, and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until thickened. When pasta is
cooked, drain thoroughly and pour into a large serving bowl. Add the sauce and the Parmesan and toss
well. Serve hot with extra Parmesan on the side.

The sauce is better made one day ahead of time and reheated. When you're reheating the sauce, then
cook the pasta according to directions on the box.
