Title: Sponge For Tiramisu
~~~

Grease a 12 1/2" X 17 1/2 " sheet pan and line the bottom and sides with foil. Grease the foil
as well.

~~~ recipe-ingredients
5 large eggs

1 1/2 cups sugar

1/2 cup water

1 1/2 tsp vanilla
~~~

Use an electric mixer to beat the eggs in a large bowl until thick and lemon colored. Gradually beat
in the sugar. Blend in the water and the vanilla.

Add and mix in to form a smooth batter:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 1/2 cup flour

1/2 tsp salt

1 1/2 tsp baking powder
~~~

Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan and bake 12 to 15 minutes in 375 degree oven until
lightly brown.

Remove from oven and let cool completely. This is best done the day before you intend to assemble
the tiramisu. When the filling for the tiramisu has been prepared, remove the foil with the cake
from the pan, slice the cake lengthwise down the middle, and slice further into 1 1/2" X 8" fingers.
