Use a Cuisinart cream together:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '1 C butter', \
    '1/3 C powdered sugar', \
    '1 tsp vanilla' \
))
~~~

Add and incorporate:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '2 C flour' \
))
~~~

Pour mixture into a mixing bowl and add and incorporate:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '1 C finely chopped pecans.' \
))
~~~

Roll the dough into 1" balls and place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees for 20
minutes.

Remove from the oven and immediately roll in powdered sugar to coat (I roll 5 - 6 cookies at a time)
and cool.

    '1/4 C powdered sugar' \
