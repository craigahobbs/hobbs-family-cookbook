Place yeast and warm water in a small bowl and stir to dissolve to form a thick paste.

Combine flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda in a large bowl. Stir together with a wire
whisk.

Cut butter and shortening into 1/2-inch pieces and sprinkle over the dry ingredients. Use fingers
to smash and break butter and shortening until they have flattened out and are about the size of
peas.

Stir yeast paste into buttermilk and them add the biscuit dough. Don't worry if all the yeast paste
isn't incorporated into the buttermilk. You just want to loosen it up a bit. Stir mixture with large
spatula until a rough dough forms. Using hands, knead the dough a few times to make sure all dry
crumbly bits at the bottom of the bowl are incorporated.

Sprinkle some flour on a clean surface. Dump the dough onto the surface and pat the dough into a
rough rectangle 1-inch thick. Then, fold the dough in half and rotate 90 degrees. Repeat this
process two more times. Sprinkle flour under the dough if it starts to stick. Do not pat too
roughly, just enough to get the dough down to 1-inch. After the final fold, pat the dough out one
more time to 1-inch.

Dip a 2-inch round biscuit cutter in flour frequently as you cut out biscuit rounds. Do not twist
the cutter: just press straight down as you cut. Repeat with all dough. Gather scraps together and
cut more biscuits until dough has been totally used.

Brush a large 10x14" pan (or 12" iron skillet) with melted butter. Place biscuits in the pan, making
sure they touch slightly. Cover biscuits with plastic wrap and let rise in the pan for 1 hour. About
15 minutes before the hour is up, preheat oven to 400 degrees.

When biscuits are done rising, brush remaining butter over the top of the biscuits. You may need to
re-melt butter in microwave for 15 seconds.

Bake biscuits for 16 to 18 minutes or until the tops of the biscuits are golden brown. Let cool in
the pan for 10 minutes before removing them to a cooling rack.

Serve warm with butter, honey and/or your choice of jam.

These are a very high-rise biscuits, very similar to the fantastic biscuits at Black Bear Diner.

\* The cut biscuits can be refrigerated overnight to bake in the morning. Take out of the refrigerator
1 hour before baking and let stand on the counter. Then bake as directed above.
