Drain and reserve the pork stock.

Chop the cooked pork finely (or larger depending on your preference) and set aside.

Using 2 glass loaf pans, line bottoms and long sides with wax paper or Saran wrap.

Refrigerate until completely chilled. Mixture will "set" due to the natural gelatin in the meat.
Un-mold the scrapple.

Slice the scrapple in 3/8" slices. Heat the butter and the vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet
or griddle, and fry the slices until golden brown and crispy on both sides. (FYI: Nonny browned her
scrapple in bacon fat - if you want the recipe to be authentic.)

Serve with butter, salt and pepper. Nonny also used to serve scrapple with maple syrup, so you can
try it both ways. Dad has fond memories of Nonny cooking this up especially for him in her kitchen. It
was one of his favorite breakfasts.
