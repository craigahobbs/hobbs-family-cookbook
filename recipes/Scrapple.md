Cut the pork shoulder into 2" cubes.

~~~ recipe-ingredients
2 lbs of trimmed pork shoulder
~~~

Place cubed pork shoulder into 4.5 qt. soup pot and add water and salt. Cover soup pot and simmer
until tender and meat falls apart (about 1.5 hours).

~~~ recipe-ingredients
6 C water

2 tsp salt
~~~

Drain and reserve the pork stock.

Chop the cooked pork finely (or larger depending on your preference) and set aside.

Measure the pork stock and return to soup pot. Bring the pork stock to a boil.

~~~ recipe-ingredients
5 C pork stock
~~~

Add slowly the yellow cornmeal and chopped pork to the pork broth - stirring constantly until thick
and smooth (about 15-20 minutes).

~~~ recipe-ingredients
2 C yellow cornmeal

Using 2 glass loaf pans, line bottoms and long sides with wax paper or Saran wrap.

Refrigerate until completely chilled. Mixture will "set" due to the natural gelatin in the meat.
Un-mold the scrapple.

Slice the scrapple in 3/8" slices. Heat the butter and the vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet
or griddle, and fry the slices until golden brown and crispy on both sides. (FYI: Nonny browned her
scrapple in bacon fat - if you want the recipe to be authentic.)

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 Tbsp butter

1 Tbsp vegetable oil
~~~

Serve with butter, salt and pepper. Nonny also used to serve scrapple with maple syrup, so you can
try it both ways. I have fond memories of Nonny cooking this up especially for me in her kitchen. It
was one of my favorite breakfasts in the day.
