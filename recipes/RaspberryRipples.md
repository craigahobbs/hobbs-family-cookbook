# Raspberry Ripples

~~~ markdown-script
recipeHeader()
~~~

Combine and process in a Cuisinart until mixture resembles course meal:

~~~ markdown-script
recipeIngredients( \
    '2 C flour', \
    '1 C butter', \
    '1/2 C sugar', \
    '1/8 tsp salt', \
    '1 beaten egg yolk' \
)
~~~

Turn dough out the mixing bowl and work into a ball. Form the ball into a long cylinder and wrap in
wax paper. Chill for thirty minutes, or until ready to bake.

Remove dough from frig, unwrap, and slice 1/4" thick and place rounds on an ungreased cookie sheet.
(about 20 per half sheet pan)

Mix together:

recipeIngredients( \
    '1/2 C raspberry jam', \
    '1/2 tsp vanilla extract' \
)
~~~

Make a thumbprint "well" in each dough round, and add a scant 1/2 tsp of raspberry mixture to it,
sprinkle with a few almond slices and bake in a 350 degree oven for 12 to 13 minutes. The cookies
should be only slightly brown on the bottoms.

This is actually Teresa's and my favorite Christmas cookie, but would be good any time of the year
with a bowl of fruit or pudding for dessert. These cookies should be layered between wax paper and
frozen for keeping. They will thaw in a few minutes for use.
