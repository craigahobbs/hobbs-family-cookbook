recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '2 1/4 lb red cabbage', \
    '1/2 C butter', \
    '6 Tbsp granulated sugar', \
    '2/3 cup balsamic vinegar' \
))
~~~

Thinly slice the red cabbage in a Cuisinart using a number two slicing disc. Melt the butter in a
large pot on medium heat. Add the cabbage and cook for five minutes. Add the granulated sugar and
toss to coat cabbage. Add the balsamic vinegar and reduce the temperature to medium low, stirring
often. Cook for at least thirty minutes until the cabbage is tender and a uniform color. Adjust the
seasoning with salt and pepper. Sometimes it is also necessary to adjust the sugar and vinegar as
the acidity of the cabbage varies.
