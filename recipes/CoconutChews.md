Cream together:

    '3/4 C butter', \
    "3/4 C confectioner's sugar" \
])
~~~

Blend in:

    '1 1/2 C flour' \

Press mixture in bottom of an ungreased 9 X13" baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes.

Mix together:

recipeIngredients([ \
    '2 beaten eggs', \

    '2 Tbsp flour', \
    '1/2 tsp baking powder', \
    '1/2 tsp salt', \

Pour mixture evenly over the hot crust and return to the oven for 20 minutes. While cookies are
still warm spread with the icing.


### Orange Lemon Icing

Mix the following together with a whisk or spoon in a small bowl until smooth:

recipeIngredients([ \
    '1 1/2 C confectioners sugar', \

These cookies are delicious and I have never served them without requests for the recipe.
