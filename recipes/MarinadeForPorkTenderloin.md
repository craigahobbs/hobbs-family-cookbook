recipeIngredients([ \
    '1/4 C olive oil', \
    '3 Tbsp soy sauce', \
    '1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce', \
    '1 tsp ground ginger', \
    '4 cloves of crushed garlic', \

Close the bag and swish around until mixed. Place two trimmed pork tenderloins in the bag, close,
and marinate for 6 to 8 hours (the longer the better). Grill until internal temperature of the port
is 160 degrees, cover with foil and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice and serve.
