Saute cut vegetables in a large skillet in olive oil just until vegetables are softened. Add one
peeled cubed potato to the chicken cooking liquid along with the sauted vegetables and the
additional chicken broth and the bay leaf. Simmer covered until all the vegetables are tender, about
20 minutes. Correct the seasoning with salt and pepper and remove the bay leaf. Thicken with the
butter mixed with the flour. Bring back to a boil to thicken before adding the dumpling dough.
