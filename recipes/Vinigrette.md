# Vinigrette

Whisk together:

recipeIngredients(arrayNew( \
    '1 clove crushed garlic', \
    '1/2 tsp Dijon mustard', \
    '1 egg yolk', \
    '3 T champagne vinegar', \
    '3/4 tsp kosher salt', \
    '1/2 tsp freshly ground pepper' \
))
~~~

Slowly whisk in the good olive oil (I like Lucini) until dressing is thick and emulsified.

    '1/2 C good olive oil' \

This dressing is great on all salads, but my favorite is mixed baby greens, sliced green onions,
sliced tomatoes, and sliced avocado.
