Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Heat olive oil in a medium saute pan. Add onions, thyme, salt and pepper, and cook over medium-heat,
stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, until the onions are translucent but not brown. Place
cooked onions in a mixing bowl and add Worcestershire sauce, chicken stock and tomato paste. Allow
to cool slightly.

Add the ground chuck, to the onion mixture. Add bread crumbs and egg, and mix lightly with a fork.
Don't mash or meatloaf will be dense.

Divide the mixture into 4 portions and shape each portion into a small "football" on a foil lined
sheet pan. Drizzle about a tbsp of ketchup on the top of each portion.

Bake for 40 minutes, until the internal temperature is 155 to 160 degrees and the meatloaves are
cooked through. Serve hot.

Optional: Serve with Dijon or Horseradish.
