# It's Your Favorite!

"It's your favorite!" cookbook was written after years of urging from Teresa (Hobbs) Ball.

I have always thought of cooking for my family as a way to show them how much I love them. Craig S.
and I have always lived in rural areas and have not always been able to access good restaurants, or
even pizza parlors. Craig S. loved good food and always had wonderful things to eat on business
trips. He would come home and describe what he had eaten and tell me that I should try to make it,
or we would eat out together and he would ask me if I could make this or that. Never one to shrink
from a challenge, I always did my best to add variety and good food to my family's table.

Over the years, I have also had the good fortune to know other good cooks who shared their recipes
with me and I have included a lot of these in my cookbook. Early in our marriage my mother gave me a
copy of Betty Crocker's New Picture Cookbook which has been a good jumping off point for lots of my
recipes. I really think that it is still one of the best cookbooks ever written. Over the course of
the last 44 years my Betty Crocker cookbook had gotten quite tattered and splattered, so a year or
so ago, Craig S. searched the internet and found an original copy in mint condition to replace my
well used one.

As I began this project, it only seemed right to include recipes from other family members who have
become good cooks. Also, since my original conception, I keep remembering more and more recipes
which needed to be included. I decided to use a loose leaf format so we could all add favorite
recipes as we remember them. I already have a list for the next installment.

It is my hope that all of you will continue to contribute recipes to this book and share them with
one another over the years. Having a good meal together is a wonderful thing!
