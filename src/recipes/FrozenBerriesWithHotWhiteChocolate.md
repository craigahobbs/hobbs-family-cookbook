Categories: Desserts
~~~

Combine in a heat proof bowl and set over a pan of simmering water and stir until chocolate melts:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 11oz package of good white chocolate chips (I prefer Guittard)

1 1/4 C heavy cream

1 Tbsp vanilla extract
~~~

Fifteen or twenty minutes before serving place any combination of (IQF) frozen raspberries, black or
marion berries, and blueberries in portion sized bowls on the counter. When chocolate sauce is hot
ladle over the berries. The berries will melt with the sauce creating a spectacular, delicious, and
easy dessert.
