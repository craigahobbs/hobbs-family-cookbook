### Pasta Dough\**

In a large mixing bowl (or on the counter\*) mix together:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
3 C flour

2 tsp salt
~~~

Stir together in a measuring cup:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1/4 C warm water

2 Tbsp olive oil

3 large eggs
~~~

Add liquid mixture to dry ingredients and stir and knead together to form a stiff dough. Knead the
dough for 10 minutes until dough is soft and smooth. Wrap the dough in saran and let it rest for 20
minutes. Cut the dough in quarters and roll out very thinly using cornstarch to keep the dough from
sticking. (use a pasta roller if you have one) Cut the dough into 16 - 4" squares; place the squares
on towels and let stand on the counter for 1 hour. Cook the pasta in batches in boiling salted
water. As each batch is done, place the cooked noodles in a large bowl of cold water.

\* Italians put a "well" in ther dry ingredients on the counter, pour the liquid mixture in the
center, and stir the two together from the center to incorporate the dry ingredients with the wet.

\** If you have access to a store that sells fresh pasta sheets, you can substitute those.

over flaps, and place seam side down in the tomato sauce. Continue until all cannelloni are done.
Pour remainder of the tomato sauce over the rolls, then the bechamel. Bake at 350 degrees until
bubbly. Remove from oven and let stand for at least 5 minutes before serving.
