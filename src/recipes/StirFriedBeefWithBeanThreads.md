### Vegetables

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 1/4 lb bok choy sliced

2 red bell peppers deveined and sliced

1 8 oz can sliced water chestnuts drained

1 inch piece ginger root pealed and sliced

2 large cloves garlic peeled and split in half

2 Tbsp oyster sauce

6 oz package bean thread noodles (cellophane noodles)

4 cup peanut oil
~~~

Heat the oil to 400 degrees in a wok for deep frying pan. Cook noodles in two batches in the oil
(turn noodles to cook both sides) until the noodles are puffed. Set aside and drain. This step is
quite dramatic and quick.

Save tbsp of the oil and stir fry the ginger and garlic, then discard. Add the drained meat slices
stirring constantly (cook in three batches until meat is done - set aside). Add 2 more Tbsp oil and
saute all the vegetables. Add the meat back in with the oyster sauce and stir to combine and until
mixture is heated through. Arrange the cooked noodles on a serving platter and heap the meat and
vegetables in the center. Serve.
