When the kids were young, and we had no money, I made our Christmas ornaments from this recipe. My
friend Norma, actually made and sold her ornaments for $4 apiece- a lot of money in those days.

~~~ recipe-ingredients
4 C flour

1 C table salt

1 1/2 C water
~~~

Mix together and knead for ten minutes until mixture forms a smooth elastic dough.

Roll the dough 1/4" thick and cut out with cookie cutter to desired shapes. Use a bamboo skewer to
make a hole at the top for a hanger, or insert a hooped bobby pin as a loop for a ribbon hanger,
being careful not to pierce the front of the ornament. Bake 1 hour at 350 degrees. Do not let the
dough turn too brown. Cool on a rack and let ornaments dry for a few days, then paint as desired. We
used model enamel, but I'm sure that any craft paint would probably work.

I had a set of cookie cutters from Hallmark that put indentations in the dough for painting lines.
Norma used to "rice" this dough with a garlic press and attach this (as hair to her angels and
beards for her santas) pressing it into the ornament with a toothpick.

These ornaments last for years and years.
