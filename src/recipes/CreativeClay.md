1 C corn starch

2 C baking soda

1 1/4 C water*
~~~

Heat over medium  burner stirring constantly until mixture reaches the consistency of moist mashed
potatoes.  Turn out on a plate, cover with plastic wrap, and cool.

This clay can be kneaded, rolled 1/4" thick, and cut out into shapes.  For permanent shapes allow
to sit out at room temperature until completely dry.  The dried shapes can be painted and saved.

The clay can be stored in airtight containers and reused.

\* Food coloring can be added to the water.
