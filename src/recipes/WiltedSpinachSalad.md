Place in a large salad bowl and toss together:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 lb washed and stemmed baby spinach

1/2 cup sliced green onions

8 washed sliced fresh white mushrooms

1 egg hard boiled cooled and chopped (set aside)

6 slices thick cut bacon sliced in 1/3" pieces
~~~

Saute bacon until crisped and drain on a paper towel.  Reserve 3 Tbsp bacon drippings in the pan.
Add and cook until bubbly:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
2 Tbsp red wine vinegar

1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice

1 tsp sugar

1/2 tsp salt
~~~

Pour the hot dressing over the spinach mixture, top with the crisped bacon and boiled eggs and
freshly ground pepper to taste.  Toss and serve immediately.

This makes a great summer meal served with hot buttered french bread and sliced fresh fruit.  I
sometimes add grated Jack cheese and toasted sunflower seeds as well.
