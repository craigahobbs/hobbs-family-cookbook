Title: Cookie "Dessert" Pizza
Categories: Cookies
~~~

Roll the tube of cookie dough into a 13" circle between a sheet of
parchment paper on the bottom and waxed paper on the top.

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 16.5 oz tube of refrigerated sugar cookie
~~~

Place the parchment paper  with the crust
on a baking sheet.  Bake at 375 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes until the pizza "crust" is just
beginning to turn light brown.

Remove the crust from the oven, lift off the baking sheet using the parchment, and cool.

When the crust is cooled, spread crust with the raspberry jelly to 3/8" of the
edge for the pizza sauce.  Sprinkle with the grated white chocolate (use a cuisinart) to
simulate the cheese.

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1/2 C seedless raspberry jelly
8 oz grated bulk white chocolate
~~~

Make "pepperoni" slices by cutting 1 1/4" diameter circles\* from cherry or strawberry fruit
leather.  Snip small pieces of apple fruit leather to sprinkle over the top for parsley.

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 variety package fruit leather
~~~

Cut in wedges to serve.   A pizza paddle makes an ideal serving platter for this.

\* I let Cooper, Colin, and Sadie cut the fruit leather, that way they can gobble up the scraps.
