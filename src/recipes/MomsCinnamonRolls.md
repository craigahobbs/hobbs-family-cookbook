(Change beater attachment to a dough hook)

Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead until completely smooth and elastic. Round the dough
into a large greased bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place until dough has doubled. Punch the
dough down and let rise a second time.

For the **stickey pecan topping**, in baking pan, mix together into a thick paste in pan bottom:

Form the rolls by punching down the dough and turning it out on a floured surface. Roll the dough

1/2 C soft butter
~~~

Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon mixture:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 C sugar
1 tsp cinnamon

Smooth mixture with hands and roll the dough beginning with the long side into a log. Pinch the
dough to seal. Cut the dough into rounds about 1 1/2" thick and place loosely in prepared pan,
leaving room for the rolls to rise. At this point the pan may be covered and frozen until about 9
hours before baking, or allowed to rise until doubled and baked in a 375 degree oven for 25 to 30
minutes until rolls sound hollow when middle roll is thumped. Remove the pan from the oven, slide
the blade of a knife around the outer edge, turn upside down on serving platter\*. Let rolls sit
upside down for a minute or two and then carefully lift pan off, scraping any leftover topping onto
the hot rolls. Best served hot.

\* I have a large flat tray that I line with foil.
