Drain and set aside.
Drain all but the necessary amount of bacon drippings, then add the olive oil to the skillet and saute the

1 Tbsp bacon drippings

2 Tbsp olive oil

1 Tbsp minced garlic

1 large diced yellow onion

3 to 4 ribs of celery diced

2 large carrots diced

2 large shallots minced

2 Tbsp molasses

1/2 C red wine

1 Tbsp worcestershire sauce
~~~

Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.

Cook covered for 1/2 hour more and add the crisped bacon and remove bay leaf and thyme sprigs.  Store
soup in a airtight container.  Soup is better the second day.  Freeze any leftover soup for another
time.
