BERRY CRISP  Recipe from Shannon Childs

Gently toss together in a buttered 9 X 13" baking dish:

 8 C frozen* or fresh berries (blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, or marian berries

               or a mixture of any of the above)

1/4 to 1/3 C flour

3/4  to 1 C sugar (depending on the sweetness of the berries)

Crust topping; mix together in a medium bowl:

1 C flour

1 C sugar

1 tsp baking powder

1 beaten egg

Mixture will look crumbly.  Spread evenly over the berries.  Melt one cube of butter and pour evenly
over the whole mixture.  Bake at 375 degrees for 45 minutes or until bubbly.

Serve with whipped cream or ice cream.

*If using frozen berries, let that slightly.

When the kids were little we would pick blackberries here on the Island and freeze them for winter
use.  We had lots of "free" desserts.
