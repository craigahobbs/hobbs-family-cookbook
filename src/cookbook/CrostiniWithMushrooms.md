CROSTINI WITH MUSHROOMS, PROSCIUTTTO, AND BLUE CHEESE

   Recipe from Teresa Ball

Saute in a large skillet until cooked through and browned (about 10 minutes):

3 Tbsp butter

1/2 lb crimini mushroom cleaned and chopped

1/4 lb shiitake mushroom caps cleaned and chopped

2 cloves chopped garlic

Add 1/2 C heavy cream and continue cooking until liquid is completely absorbed (about 2 minutes).
Remove from heat and add 1/2 C blue cheese (I prefer gorgonzola) and stir until melted.  Mix in 1/2 C
thinly sliced proscuitto (about 2 1/2 oz) and season to taste with salt and pepper.*

Slice an 18" baguette into 1/2" slices and bake at 375 degrees until golden (about 5 minutes).
Spread each slice with about a tablespoon of the mushroom mixture and return to the oven until
topping is heated through and bubbly (about 6 minutes).  Sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley and
serve.

These appetizers are delicious and always a hit!

*Can be made ahead and refrigerated 1 day ahead of serving.
