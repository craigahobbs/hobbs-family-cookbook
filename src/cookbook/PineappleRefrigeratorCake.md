PINEAPPLE REFRIGERATOR  CAKE   Recipe from Aunt Laura

Mix together:

3 C graham cracker crumbs

1/2 C melted butter

1/4 C sugar

Press mixture into a 9" X 13" pan reserving 1 3/4 C for the topping.

Mix together and dissolve:

1 pkg lemon Jello

1 1/4 C hot water

1/3 C sugar

While mixture is still hot, add 1 - 8 oz pkg cubed cream cheese and stir until well blended.
Chill the mixture until the consistency of thick cream and whip with an electric mixer until fluffy.
 Stir in 1 small can of crushed pineapple, drained.

Prepare 2 pkgs of Dream Whip (artificial whipped cream, low fat*) until stiff.  Fold into the Jello
mixture and pour evenly over the crust.  Sprinkle with the reserved crumbs and chill at least 3
hours.

*Substitute 1 1/2 C whipped cream, not low in fat, but still available.  Dream Whip used to be found
in the Jello and Pudding area of the grocery store.  I honestly don't know if Dream Whip is still
made.

This was one of Craig A.'s favorites.
