BUTTER ALMOND COOKIES  from Karen Sandberg

Cream together:

1 C butter

1/2 C sugar

Add and mix in:

2 C flour

3/4 C slivered blanched almonds

1 tsp vanilla

Roll the dough into large walnut sized balls and chill for 20 minutes.  Remove dough from frig and
place on and ungreased cookie sheet spaced 2" apart.  Using your thumb and index fingers, pinch
and slightly flatten the top of each ball. Bake at 325 degrees for 25 minutes until just slightly
browned.  Remove to a cooling rack and dust with powdered sugar.

I usually make these in a double batch.  Sadie calls these cookies "reindeer prints" because
that is what they look like.
