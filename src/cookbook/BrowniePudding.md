BROWNIE PUDDING

Stir together by hand:

1 C flour

2 tsp baking powder

3/4 C sugar

1/4 tsp salt

2 Tbsp cocoa

2 Tbsp melted shortening or butter

1/2 C milk

Spread batter in a  9 X 9" baking pan.

Mix together and sprinkle over the batter:

1 C brown sugar packed

1/4 C cocoa

Pour 1 3/4 C hot water over all and bake in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes.  During baking crispy

and serve warm with freshly whipped cream.
