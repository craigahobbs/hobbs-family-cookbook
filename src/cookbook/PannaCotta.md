PANNA COTTA    Recipe from Matt Kramer*

This recipe is not heart healthy, but it is really delicious and easy to make.  It looks and tastes
like you spent hours in the kitchen making it.

1 envelope unflavored gelatin

1/4 Cup cold water

Sprinkle gelatin over the water in a small bowl and let sit for 5 minutes.

1 quart heavy cream

1 1/4  cups sugar

Place cream in a heavy saucepan bring it to a NEAR boil over medium heat.  Gently whisk in the
gelatin and the sugar.  Continue to whisk for about five minutes until the sugar has dissolved.
Remove from the heat and let cool completely.

When mixture is cool, place it in 8- 4 ounce ramekins and refrigerate several hours until panna
cotta is set.

To serve, run a thin bladed knife blade around the edges of the ramekins, turn upside down on
serving plates.  Spoon sweetened berries over the top in the summer, or chocolate and caramel sauces
in the winter.

*   Matt used to be the wine critic for the Portland newspaper, but later went on to be a writer for
Wine Spectator.  He was kind enough to help us plan our trip to Italy 10 years ago and gave so many
great suggestions for places to eat and stay.
