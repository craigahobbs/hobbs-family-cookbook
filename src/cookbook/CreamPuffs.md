CREAM PUFFS    Recipe from Laura Ferguson (Aunt Laura)

Heat to a rolling boil in a large saucepan:

1 C water

1/2 C butter

Add and stir in over low heat until a ball forms:

1 C flour

Remove from heat and beat in 4 eggs, one at a time until smooth.  Drop the batter by spoon onto an
ungreased baking sheet, 3" apart.  Makes 8 large puffs.  Bake 45 to 50 minutes in a 400 degree
oven.  Allow the puffs to cool slowly away from drafts.  To store, cover with clean towel on a plate
on the counter.

To serve, cut the tops off the puffs, clean out any moist membranes inside, and fill with the
following, dust with powdered sugar.

CREAM FILLING

1 large pkg (4.6 oz) Jello cook & serve vanilla pudding (see preparation below)

1 C whipping cream beaten firmly

1/2 tsp rum extract

Prepare the pudding according to package directions, except use only 2 1/2 C milk (I always use
diluted evaporated milk).  Turn the cooked pudding into a large bowl and chill until firm.  Fold in
the beaten whipped cream and rum flavoring and spoon into the puffs.

This has always been a favorite family dessert.  When Aunt Marilin and Uncle Jim and I were kids, we
wouldn't have gotten dessert very often if it hadn't been for Aunt Laura.  She came to Sunday
dinner every week, and always brought dessert.  Everything she made was great.
