Sponge for Tiramisu

Grease a 12 (1/2)"  X  17 (1/2) "  sheet pan and line the bottom and sides with foil.  Grease the foil as well.

Use an electric mixer to beat together 5 large eggs in a large bowl until thick and lemon colored.   Gradually  beat in 1 (1/2)  cups sugar.  Blend in (1/2) cup water and 1 (1/2)  tsp.  vanilla.

Add and mix in to form a smooth batter:

1 (1/2) cup flour
(1/2) tsp. salt
1 (1/2) tsp. baking powder

Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan and bake 12 to 15 minutes in 375 degree oven until lightly brown.

Remove from oven and let cool completely.  This is best done the day before you intend to assemble the tiramisu.  When the filling for the tiramisu has been prepared, remove the foil with the cake from the pan, slice the cake lengthwise down the middle, and slice further into 1(1/2)" X 8" fingers.
