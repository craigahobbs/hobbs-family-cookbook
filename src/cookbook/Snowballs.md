SNOWBALLS    Recipe from Nonny (Helen Minkiewitz)

Use a Cuisinart cream together:

1 C butter

1/3 C powdered sugar

1 tsp vanilla

Add and incorporate:

2 C flour

Pour mixture into a mixing bowl and add and incorporate 1 C finely chopped pecans.

Roll the dough into 1" balls and place on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20
minutes.  Remove from the oven and immediately roll in powdered sugar to coat (I roll 5 - 6
cookies at a time) and cool.
