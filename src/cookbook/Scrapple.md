SCRAPPLE   Recipe from Helen Minkiewitz (Nonny)

Cut 2 lbs. of trimmed pork shoulder into 2" cubes.

Place cubed pork shoulder into 4.5 qt. soup pot and add 6 C water with 2 tsp salt.  Cover soup pot
and simmer until tender and meat falls apart (about 1.5 hours).

Drain and reserve the pork stock.

Chop the cooked pork finely (or larger depending on your preference) and set aside.

Measure 5 C pork stock and return to soup pot.  Bring the pork stock to a boil.

Add slowly 2 C yellow cornmeal and chopped pork to the pork broth - stirring constantly until
thick and smooth (about 15-20 minutes).

Using 2 glass loaf pans, line bottoms and long sides with wax paper or Saran wrap.

Refrigerate until completely chilled.  Mixture will "set" due to the natural gelatin in the
meat.  Un-mold the scrapple.

Slice the scrapple in 3/8" slices.  Heat 1 Tbsp butter and I Tbsp vegetable oil in a large
nonstick skillet or griddle, and fry the slices until golden brown and crispy on both sides.  (FYI:
Nonny browned her scrapple in bacon fat - if you want the recipe to be authentic.)

Serve with butter, salt and pepper.  Nonny also used to serve scrapple with maple syrup, so you can
try it both ways.  I have fond memories of Nonny cooking this up especially for me in her kitchen.
It was one of my favorite breakfasts in the day.
