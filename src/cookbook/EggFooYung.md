EGG FOO YUNG   Recipe from Teresa Ball

Rinse and pat dry 1 1/2 C fresh bean sprouts and set aside in a large mixing bowl.

Chop 3 to four large cleaned mushrooms and add to the sprouts.

Using a Cuisinart, finely chop 1 large, lean, pork loin chop.  Saute the ground pork in a small
amount of vegetable oil.  Add the cooled, cooked pork to the vegetables.

Add 3 beaten eggs to the above mixture with a dash or two of salt.  Stir together with a fork until
well combined.  Set aside until sauce is ready.

For the sauce, mix together:

1 Tbsp soy sauce

1/2 tsp salt

1 Tbsp cornstarch

In a small saucepan, bring 3/4 C chicken stock to a boil.  Stir in the soy mixture and cook for 2
minutes until sauce thickens and becomes clear.  Keep warm until foo yung is cooked.

Heat a large skillet with one Tbsp of vegetable oil, add a ladle full of the foo yung mixture and
cook and flip as you would pancakes.  Set the foo yung on a warmed serving platter and continue to
cook until all the batter is used.   More oil should be added as needed for frying.

To serve cover the foo yung with the warm sauce and sprinkle with sliced green onions.  Serve with
steamed broccoli and more soy sauce as desired.
