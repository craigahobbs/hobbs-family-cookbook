Place the red peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded skin side up on a foil lined cookie sheet.
Bake in a 500 degree oven until the pepper skin is blackened.  Remove the peppers to a plastic bag,

slip the skins off,  and cut each in half again.  Place quartered peppers in a bowl and drizzle with
the fresh lemon juice and black pepper.
