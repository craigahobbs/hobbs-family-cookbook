Categories: Miscellaneous
~~~

The only sauce to serve with baked salmon.

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1/4 C white wine (champagne) vinegar

2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice

2 Tbsp dry vermouth

1 Tbsp finely minced shallots

1/2 tsp salt

1 C butter
~~~

Add the first 5 ingredients to a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil.  Cook until reduced to 1 1/2
Tbsp.  Remove from the heat and whisk in two pats of butter.  Return the pan to low heat and
continue to whisk in pats of butter (each time waiting until the previous pats have been
incorporated into the sauce) until the sauce become thick and ivory colored.  Remove from the heat,
correct seasoning, and serve over baked salmon.  Absolutely delicious and very decadent.
