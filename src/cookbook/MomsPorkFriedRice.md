MOM'S PORK FRIED RICE

One day ahead (this is a very important step as it prevents the rice from sticking during the frying
process), cook 1 C of white rice in 2 C chicken broth.  Refrigerate, covered, overnight.

Saute, stirring,  in 2 to three Tbsp vegetable oil and 1 tsp sesame oil, in a large non stick
skillet, until tender crisp:

1 yellow onion, julienned

1 peeled carrot sliced in half and then in 1/4" slices

Add and continue stir frying until everything is hot:

1 C diced barbequed pork (pork and sesame)

cooked rice

3/4  C frozen peas

When almost hot add and stir in to scramble:

1 egg beaten with 2 tsp water

soy sauce to taste

Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and thinly diagonally sliced green onions and serve with steamed
broccoli (basted with soy sauce and a little butter).
