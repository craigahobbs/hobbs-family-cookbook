HERBED BAKED MUSHROOMS

Mix together in a 1 qt buttered baking dish:

1 lb cleaned, trimmed, halved fresh mushroom caps

2 Tbsp melted butter

1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice

1 tsp dried dill weed

1/2 tsp onion powder

1/2 tsp salt

freshly ground pepper to taste

Cover with foil and bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes or until mushrooms are tender and golden
brown.

This is a great easy appetizer (served warm with toothpicks), or served with beef roast as a side
dish.
