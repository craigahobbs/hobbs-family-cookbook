Adjust sweetness to your taste by adding more fresh milk or sugar.

Serve hot with marshmallows or whipped cream.

Best served to cold kids coming in from playing in the snow.

I used to take this to soccer games in our cooler (stays warm that way) and serve it in insulated
cups.  Everyone liked my hot chocolate the best - I think it's the canned milk mixed with the
fresh milk that gives it such a creamy taste.
