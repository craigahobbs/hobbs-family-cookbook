POPOVERS

Oil two Chicago@ metallic nonstick popover pans.  Cut 2 Tbsp butter into cubes and place one dot in
each of eight popover cups.

Blend together until the mixture is the consistency of thick cream:

1 1/4 C flour

1/4 tsp salt

3 large eggs at room temperature

1 1/4 C milk at room temperature

2 Tbsp melted butter

Heat the oven to 400 degrees.  When oven is up to temp, heat the prepared pans until butter is
melted.  Remove the pans and divide the batter evenly into eight cups.  Bake the popovers for 20
minutes, then reduce the oven temp to 300 degrees and continue to bake for 20 minutes.  The popovers
will be 4 to 5 inches high and brown when done.  Mine usually finish up about 5 minutes early.

Remove the popovers from the oven and immediately remove to a serving basket.  You may need to
loosen popovers by running a sharp knife around the edge of the cup, but usually they lift right
out.  Serve hot with butter and seedless raspberry jelly.

Popovers are one of Dad's favorite breakfasts.  He originally enjoyed them at the Hughes House
(our mutual friend, Johnny, when we were 5 and 6 years of age).  This recipe makes exactly 8
popovers, and they turn out perfectly everytime.
