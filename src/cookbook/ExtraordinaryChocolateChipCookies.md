Title: Extraordinary Chocolate Chip Cookies
Categories: Cookies
~~~

Cream together until light and fluffy:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 1/2 C butter
~~~

Add and continue to cream:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 1/4 C sugar

1 1/4 C packed light brown sugar

2 eggs

1 Tbsp vanilla extract
~~~

Add and mix together:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
4 C flour (I lightly toss the flour before measuring it)

2 tsp baking soda

1/2 tsp salt
~~~

With the mixer on the lowest speed, add in 4 cups of semisweet chocolate chips.  This forms a really
stiff, chocolatey dough and makes a huge batch of cookies.  I roll the dough in large (almost golf
ball sized) balls and freeze them on a cookie sheet.  When frozen, place balls in Ziploc bag.  To
bake cookies place up to 12 balls on a cookie sheet, allow to thaw completely at room temperature,
and bake at 350 degrees for 11 to 13 minutes.  Baked cookies should be underdone and just barely
light brown.  Allow to stand on the cookie sheet for 1 minute before transferring cookies to a
cooling rack.

Coarsely chopped nuts may be added to the dough with the chips.

2 C coarsely chopped nuts (optional)

These chocolate chip cookies are really the best we've ever tasted and live up to the billing of
**extraordinary**!
