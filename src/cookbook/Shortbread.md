In a large mixing bowl, soften by massaging and working with your hands and fingers until no hard
lumps remain:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 lb cold butter (4 sticks)
~~~

Add and mix in with a spoon until totally incorporated:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
1 C sugar
~~~

Add and mix with a spoon or hands if needed:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
4 C flour

1/2 tsp salt
~~~

Form the dough into a ball.  Press the dough onto a baking sheet so it is about 1/2" thick, and cut
into 1 1/4" X 3" pieces.  Pierce each piece with a fork.  Place shortbread into a preheated 425
degree oven.  IMMEDIATELY turn the oven down to 325 degrees and bake for 35 to 40 minutes.  The
shortbread is done when the bottom is "sandy brown" in color.

This is a difficult recipe to do.  The mixtures need to be kept cold at all stages, and working the
butter is time consuming and cold.  The reward is absolutely delicious shortbread.
