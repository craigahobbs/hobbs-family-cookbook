MOM'S CINNAMON ROLLS

Large Batch (10 1/2 " X 14 1/2 " pan)                      Small Batch (9 1/2 X 13" pan)

Dissolve yeast in a  large mixing bowl and let proof for 10 minutes:

(Use a stand mixer with a paddle attachment)

1/2 C  water at 110 degrees                                     1/4  C water

2 Tbsp dry active yeast                                          1 Tbsp yeast

2 tsp sugar                                                              1 tsp sugar

Add and mix in:

1/2 C butter                                                              1/4 C butter

1/2 C sugar                                                               1/4 C sugar

2 beaten eggs                                                         1 beaten egg

2 tsp salt                                                                1 tsp salt

1 1/2 C lukewarm milk                                           3/4  C warm milk

4 C flour                                                                2 C flour

When mixture forms a smooth "batter" mix in and continue to beat until a smooth dough forms:

(Change beater attachment to a dough hook)

3 to 3 1/2 C flour                                                    1 1/2 C flour

Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead until completely smooth and elastic.  Round the
dough into a large greased bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place until dough has doubled.  Punch
the dough down and let rise a second time.

Stickey Pecan Topping

In baking pan mix together into a thick paste in pan bottom:

1/2 C butter softened                                            1/3 C butter softened

1 C packed brown sugar                                     2/3 C brown sugar

2 to 3 Tbsp dark corn syrup                               1 1/2 Tbsp corn syrup

Sprinkle with pecan halves (about 1 1/2 C and 1 C respectively).

Form  the rolls by punching down the dough and turning it out on a floured surface.  Roll the dough
into a large rectangle (20 X 15" or 15 X 9" respectively).  Spread rectangle with 1/2 C soft
butter for the large recipe and sprinkle with 1 C sugar mixed with 1 tsp cinnamon.  Smooth mixture
with hands and roll the dough beginning with the long side into a log.  Pinch the dough to seal.
Cut the dough into rounds about 1 1/2" thick and place loosely in prepared pan, leaving room for
the rolls to rise.  At this point the pan may be covered and frozen until about 9 hours before
baking, or allowed to rise until doubled and baked in a 375 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes until
rolls sound hollow when middle roll is thumped.  Remove the pan from the oven, slide the blade of a
knife around the outer edge, turn upside down on serving platter*.  Let rolls sit upside down for a
minute or two and then carefully lift pan off, scraping any leftover topping onto the hot rolls.
Best served hot.

*  I have a large flat tray that I line with foil.
