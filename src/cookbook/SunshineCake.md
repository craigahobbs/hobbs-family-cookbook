SUNSHINE CAKE   Recipe from Nonny (Helen Minkiewitz)

A two time blue ribbon winner at the Oregon State Fair in Salem

In a medium bowl beat together until the consistency of mayonnaise:

7 egg yolks (reserve egg whites for next step)

1 1/4 C sugar

2 Tbsp water

Add and stir in:

Juice of 1/2 fresh lemon

Zest of the whole lemon

1 C flour

In a large bowl, beat the 7 egg whites, 1 tsp cream of tartar, and 1/8 tsp salt until very stiff.
Fold the stiffly beaten whites into the yolk mixture.  Pour batter evenly into an ungreased angel
food cake pan and bake for 45 to 50 minutes at 350 degrees.

Cool the cake in the pan.  When cool, loosen the edges and bottom with a sharp knife and place
upside down on a serving plate.  Frost with glaze, recipe follows.

LEMON GLAZE

1 C confectioners sugar

1 tsp lemon juice

1/2 tsp lemon zest

1 Tbsp milk

This was the favorite birthday cake in Dad's family.  Nonny continued to bake it on request until
well into her eighties.  It turned out perfectly every time!
