BEACH CAFE FETTUCCINE

Preheat a large skillet and saute until browned and cooked through:

1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts sliced into small strips and seasoned with salt and pepper

1/4 C olive oil

Remove the chicken from the skillet with a slotted spoon, reduce heat and add:

3 oz sundried tomatoes sliced (reconstituted or drained packed in oil)

6 canned artichoke hearts quartered

2 oz shiitake mushrooms, cleaned and sliced

3 tbsp chopped fresh garlic

2 Tbsp shallots, finely diced

large pinch red pepper flakes

Stir and cook for 2 minutes being careful not to burn the garlic.  Deglaze the pan with 3/4 C dry
sherry and reduce for 1 minute.  Add 3 C heavy cream plus 3/4 tsp salt and reduce until thickened.
Add back the cooked chicken and continue to reduce if necessary.  Correct seasoning with additional
salt and pepper to taste.

Cook 1 lb fettuccine noodles to al dente per package instructions.  Drain the noodles and toss with
the sauce and 1/2 C grated parmesan cheese.  Serve immediately with more parmesan and chopped
parsley.
