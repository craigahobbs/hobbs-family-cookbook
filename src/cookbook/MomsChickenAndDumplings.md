Salt and pepper two large, bone in, skin on, chicken breasts.  Sear the chicken in 1 to 2 Tbsp olive
oil in a 6 qt dutch oven.  When chicken is browned, add 4 C water and and simmer, covered, until
chicken is tender.  Remove the chicken and allow to cool.  When chicken is cool, remove the skin and
bones and shred into 1 1/2" pieces.  Refrigerate the chicken until ready to add back.

one peeled cubed potato to the chicken cooking liquid along with the sauted vegetables and 2  C
