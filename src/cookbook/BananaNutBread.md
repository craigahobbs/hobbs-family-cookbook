BANANA NUT BREAD    Recipe from Merlin Salter

Cream together:

1/2 C butter

1 C sugar

Add and beat in:

2 eggs

4 Tbsp sour milk*

3 mashed ripe bananas

Add and stir in:

2 C flour

1 tsp soda

1/2 C chopped pecans

Turn the batter into a buttered glass loaf pan and bake in a 350 degree for 1 hour or until a
toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.  Cool the bread in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes,
then loosen the edges with a knife blade and turn out onto a cutting board and continue to cool or
slice and serve.

*4 Tbsp milk and 2 tsp white vinegar (I'm convinced that this step is what makes this banana bread
so great.  Use vinegar, not lemon juice.)

I sometimes double the recipe and freeze the second loaf.
