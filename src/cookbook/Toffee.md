Combine in a large saucepan:

~~~ recipe-ingredients
2 C butter

2 C sugar

2/3 C brown sugar

6 Tbsp light Karo syrup (dark Karo does not give the same crispy texture to the finished candy

4 Tbsp water (1/4 C)
~~~

Stir frequently and cook over medium heat until the candy reaches 280 - 290

degrees on a candy thermometer or hard crack stage*, when dropped in cold water about 25 minutes.

Remove from heat and stir in the baking soda and the toasted almonds.

1 tsp baking soda
1 1/2 C roughly chopped toasted whole almonds

Turn out on a greased sheet pan and allow to cool slightly.  While still quite warm, sprinkle with
the chocolate chips or the broken milk chocolate bars,  allow to melt and spread
over top of the cooling candy.

Break apart into pieces by lifting the edges off the sheet
pan with a table knife and snapping the candy.

Keep the candy layered between waxed paper in an airtight container.

*Drop a small amount of the cooking candy into ice water.  The candy should separate into hard
"threads" and be crunchy when tasted.
