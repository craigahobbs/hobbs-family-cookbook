# Recipe Know How

Always **READ THE RECIPE COMPLETELY** to make sure you have all of the ingredients on hand before
you begin.

When baking:

- Always measure. Baking depends on the chemistry of the ingredients.

- Always aerate (shake or scoop and drop) your flour before measuring it with the dip, level method.
  Your baked goods will be lighter and less dense.

- Use evaporated milk in recipes using yeast and you won't have to scald the milk.

- Make sure that all of your ingredients are fresh. Flour (especially whole wheat), shortening, and
  leavening (baking powder, baking soda, and yeast) can get stale.

- Measure shortening by filling a large measuring cup with 1 cup water, then scoop the shortening
  into the water and measure the displacement (a tip I learned from Teresa).

- Make sure not to miss any of the recipe "steps".

When cooking:

- Always use fresh ingredients. Wash all vegetables and herbs carefully, including organic produce.

- Do not hesitate to "tweak" a recipe to your own taste. Be creative.

- Measuring is sometimes "approximate".

- When making salad, fill a large bowl with cold water and suspend your greens in it, swish and let
  the sediment fall away (a tip I learned from Craig A.)

- Dry ingredients such as rice and beans can get stale.

- A little bit of chopped parsley makes everything look more appetizing.

- Variety really is the spice of life. Even a great dish served too often, gets old. A lesson I
  learned and hence the meaning behind the title of my cookbook.
